    "# OCaml from the very beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to study at least two chapters of the book [OCaml from the very beginning](http://ocaml-book.com/) and do the excercises here. I tried to do this in the past but I never finished, I have to stop doing that for 2018 and finish what I start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 1, basics are first!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we learnt the basics about programming in general. For example, OCaml is _an expression language_, **values** are **expressions** but they cannot be reduced further.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "1 + 2 ;;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "- : int = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And it means the _expression `1+2`_ returns the _value `3`_ of type **int**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators `mod, /, *` have precedence over the operators `+, -` and the binary operator `&&` has precedence over `||` but both boolean operators has no precedence over `+, -, mod, /, *`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises (answers)\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. _What are the types of the following expressions and what do they evaluate to? Why?_\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * $17$ \n",
    "      - `-:int = 7` \n",
    "      - Easy, it is just a value and it is an integer\n",
    "    * $1 + 2 * 3 + 4$ \n",
    "      - `-:int = 11` \n",
    "      - Again, multiplication has precedence over addition\n",
    "    * $800 / 80 / 8$ \n",
    "      - `-:int = 1` \n",
    "      - You will probably say `1.25` but the truth is that `/` is the integer division so it will return an integer\n",
    "    * $400 > 200$ \n",
    "      - `-:bool = true`\n",
    "      - Easy, it is just a boolean operation\n",
    "    * $1 <> 1$\n",
    "      - `-:bool = false`\n",
    "      - The confusing part is the `<>` which means different, and no, 1 is not different than 1\n",
    "    * true || false\n",
    "      - `-:bool = true`\n",
    "      - Remember, `||` is true if _only one of the members is true_\n",
    "    * if true then false else true\n",
    "      - `-:bool = false`\n",
    "      - Both return values are boolean so the result is boolean, and _true is always true_\n",
    "    * '%'\n",
    "      - `-:char = %`\n",
    "      - It is only a character\n",
    "    * 'a' + 'b'\n",
    "      - **Error!** there is no operation to concatenate char types!\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. _Consider the evaluation of the expression `1 + 2 mod 3`, `(1 + 2) mod 3` and `1 + (2 mod 3)`. What can you conclude about the `+` and `mod` operators?_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The only thing I can conclude on is that `mod` has higher precedence than the `+` operator, so the operation `1 + (2 mod 3)` is the equivalent to `1 + 2 mod 3`\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. _A programmer writes `1+2 * 3+4`. What does this evaluates to? What advice will you give him?_\n",
    " \n",
    "    * The expression evaluates to `-:int = 11`\n",
    "    * I will tell him: First, put spaces between your sum operands, that doesn't make the stuff goes in your order, if you want to do the sum first and then multiply, use parenthesis like this `(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)` and it looks nicer than your version.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 4. _The range of numbers available is limited. There are two special numbers: `min_int` and `max_int`. What are their values on your computer? What happens when you evaluate the expressions `max_int + 1` and `min_int - 1`?_\n",
    " \n",
    "    * I will assume it will throw an error becasue, guess what, they are the max and min.\n",
    "    * In my machine they are absurd big numbers, `max_int` is `-:int = 4611686018427387903` and `max_min` is the same but negative  \n",
    "    \n",
    " 5. _What happens when you try to evaluate the expression `1 / 0` Why?_\n",
    "\n",
    "    * It will throw an error\n",
    "    * Basic mathematics my friend, you cannot divide a number between nothing, it doesn't even make sense\n",
    "     \n",
    " 6. _Can you discover what the mod operator does when one or both of the operands are negative? What about if the first operand is zero? What if the second is zero?_\n",
    " \n",
    "    * When both are negative? it will be negative\n",
    "    * When one is negative? it depends, if the first operand is, it is negative, if the second you still positive\n",
    "    * When the first is zero, you are zero my friend\n",
    "    * When the second is zero, you have an error, the same as the previous question.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 7. _Why not just use, for example, the integer 0 to represent false and the integer 1 for true? Why have a separate bool type at all?_\n",
    " \n",
    "    * I guess because they are integers, and we will be wasting space for something that is just binary? internally they are just 0 and one my friend.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 8. _What is the effect of the comparison operators like `<` and `>` on alphabetic values of type char? For example, what does `'p' < 'q'` evaluate to? What is the effect of the comparison operators on the booleans, `true` and `false`?_\n",
    " \n",
    "    * It basically kind of convert the char into int in the order they are, the result will be `-:bool`\n",
    "    * The result is `-:bool` as well, it converts `true` to 1 and `false` to 0, it will be the equivalent to `1 > 0`"
