# Learning OCaml

I had been through the book [Learning OCaml from the very beginning](http://ocaml-book.com/) and doing the exercises and some notes.

This is the result of my journey through this ML language.

I used [Jupyter OCaml](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter) as a kernel for OCaml in Jupyter, you can go and install it yourself or use the [Docker image for IOCaml](https://hub.docker.com/r/akabe/iocaml/), I recommend this last one, specially since this is just a beginner book yet.

You can access it with:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 --rm -v <notebooks>:/notebooks akabe/iocaml
```

Where `<notebooks>` is the directory where you put the download (or cloned) notebooks.
